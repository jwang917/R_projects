```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#Some code below:
For bold use **AAA**, for italiac use *AAA*, for equation use $p_X(x) = e^(i \pi)$
`Var <- a`
var <- b

About the global options: 
  **eval**:the code won't be evaluate it. 
  **echo**:used in graph generation. 
  **include**:for some very simple codes. 
```{r try-out }

```

## R Markdown
**This is a bold statement.**
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

*Why not make it a little bit italian.*
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
